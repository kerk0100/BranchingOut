# Project Progress <br />
## Project Description <br />

Our project is a web application for the coffee enthusiasts of Vancouver. It provides a platform for people to discuss, review and recommend coffee shops and to keep tabs on the places their friends review. <br />

## Project Task Requirement

Minimal requirements: <br />
* Ability to add friends [YES]<br />
* Ability to post reviews [YES]<br />
* Ability to view other friends’ reviews (on the feed)[YES] <br />
* User has the ability to log into/create an account [YES]<br />
* Ability to view a map of Vancouver with all coffee shops [YES]<br />

Standard requirements: <br />
* Find cafes within a certain radius of an inputted location (on the map)<br />
* Ability to edit review after it’s been posted (on your profile) [YES] <br />
* Users can upload pictures (part of the review) [YES]<br />
* Ability to see the history of all the reviews you’ve written (on your profile) [YES]<br />

Stretch requirements: <br />
* Machine learning to analyze reviews [NO]<br />
* Integration with third-party apps/social media [NO]<br />
* Add friends to the review → tagging friends [NO]<br /> <br />

## How tech from Units 1-5 are used in the project:

* Consistent styling with CSS is used throughout the project (Unit 1)<br />
* Our project is split into components and both React and Redux states are used throughout the application(Unit 2)<br />
* We store all our data in a persisting MongoDB database, and issue REST commands such as GET/POST/etc.. to read, update, and delete data accordingly (Unit 3/4)<br />
* We have deployed our project with Heroku, and it can be accessed [here](coffee-brewsters-app.herokuapp.com) (Unit 5)<br /><br />

## Above and Beyond

* Our group had never worked with web development technologies before, so the teachings in this course were completely new to us. For this reason, we made the decision to manually style our project using CSS, as we felt that it would better build up our foundation if compared to using a styling library or framework. It was a challenge at times, but our team collectively agreed that this choice gave us a deeper understanding and appreciation of the work that goes into styling a front end. Furthermore, we made use of OpenStreetMap to enhance the usability of our product, as it allows users to interact with our data in a more visual manner. We also experimented with different types of data, allowing users to upload both text and image data when creating a review. Furthermore, we all took great care to put in extra time and detail when debugging and designing our application. We did this by creating lo-fi prototypes, having team brainstorming sessions, and frequent pair-programming sessions.  <br /> <br />

## Description of Next Steps

* To improve the app, we would add more functionality to the map component, and make the app more robust. There are a few UX issues that can be improved. The way that the user posts a review could be moved to a different page, perhaps as a popup on the main feed page. Also, the map needs to respond to where the user is located to provide a better experience of discovering local cafes. <br /> <br />
