# Project Progress <br />
## Project Description <br />

Our project is a web application for the coffee enthusiasts of Vancouver. It provides a platform for people to discuss, review and recommend coffee shops and to keep tabs on the places their friends review. <br />

## Project Task Requirement

Minimal requirements: <br />
* Ability to add friends [YES]<br />
* Ability to post reviews [YES]<br />
* Ability to view other friends’ reviews (on the feed)[YES] <br />
* User has the ability to log into/create an account [YES]<br />
* Ability to view a map of Vancouver with all coffee shops [YES]<br />

Standard requirements: <br />
* Find cafes within a certain radius of an inputted location (on the map) [NO]<br />
* Ability to edit review after it’s been posted (on your profile) [YES] <br />
* Users can upload pictures (part of the review) [YES]<br />
* Ability to see the history of all the reviews you’ve written (on your profile) [YES]<br />

Stretch requirements: <br />
* Machine learning to analyze reviews [NO]<br />
* Integration with third-party apps/social media [NO]<br />
* Add friends to the review → tagging friends [YES]<br /> <br />

## How tech from Units 1-5 are used in the project:

* Consistent styling with CSS is used throughout the project (Unit 1)<br />
* Our project is split into components and states are used for the majority (Unit 2)<br />
* We store all our data in MongoDB, and GET/POST/etc.. accordingly (Unit 3/4)<br />
* We have deployed our project with Heroku (Unit 5)<br /><br />

## Above and Beyond

* Our group had never worked with web development technologies before, so the teachings in this course were new to us. The way we went above and beyond was the time and detail we spent debugging our code and working together to come up with a solution. <br /> <br />

## Description of Next Steps

* To improve the app, we would add more functionality to the map component, and make the app more robust. There are a few UX issues that can be improved. The way that the user posts a review needs to appear more connected with the feed. Also, the map needs to respond to where the user is located to provide a better experience of discovering local cafes. <br /> <br />
